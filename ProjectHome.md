The Smart Digg Button extension for Firefox places a button in your status bar. It uses the Digg API to determine if the web page you are currently viewing has been submitted to Digg.

If the page you are viewing has been submitted to Digg, it displays the current number of Diggs the page has. Pressing the button takes you to the submission.

If the page you are viewing has not been submitted, pressing it takes you to Diggâ€™s submission form where you can submit the page to Digg.

Compatibility: Firefox version 1.5 - 3.1b2
